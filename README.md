# To-do-list
Simple To do list program using priority queue in c
Use of priority queues to manage tasks in a to-do list, ensuring that higher-priority tasks are processed before lower-priority ones, enabling effective time management. 

*CONSIDERATIONS:
The overall time complexity for the operations in the provided code can be approximated as O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the priority queue.
Overall, the space complexity of this priority queue implementation remains constant, O(1), regardless of the number of tasks added to the priority queue or the fixed MAX_SIZE of the queue. This analysis assumes that the number of tasks added does not exceed the predefined MAX_SIZE.
